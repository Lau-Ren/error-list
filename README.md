Errors and messages seen in console, and their solutions


## Kendo Grid

- cannot toggle group collapse/expand

   > I was using the kendo directive and trying to initialise with jquery
   > class name interefed
   
- update requests after incell changes were trying to update with the old value, not the new changed value.

   > the saveChanges() method on grid cannot be called within the save event function, i think it triggers before the actual dataitem is        updated, even if it is changed in cell.
   
## webpack-dev-server/keycloak (?) issues 

- 413 Request Entity Too Large

## Angular

- Could'nt pass a value to a directive with $scope
   
   > the variable name was camelCase so the variable name in the view where the directive was being used needed to have '-'s
      e.g.
      ``` return {
        scope: {
            datasetMetas: '=',
            settings: '=',
            datasets: '='
        },
        ...```
       
       ```< my-directive settings=vm.settings dataset-metas= ...```
        

- view template not rendering
   
   > check component or directive name matches the normalised html el name (ie uiSelect -> `<ui-select></ui-select>`

            jQuery: "jquery",
            'window.jQuery': "jquery"
        })
      ` in the webpack.make\
      
- ` Argument 'fn' is not a function, got string `

      > ` .config()` and/or `.run()` were named
       ie `config('appAppConfig', appAppConfig)` 
       
      They expect a single argument only, function or array, and shouldn't be named
